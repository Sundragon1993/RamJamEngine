RamJamEngine
============

The RamJamEngine is a game/rendering engine for learning purposes only.
I wanted to learn 3D graphics using OpenGL and DirectX.
I first began with the Rastertek tutorials (http://www.rastertek.com/)
Unfortunately, the architecture wasn't robust enough (IMO), so I decided to create my own Game/Rendering Engine.

The RJE is based on the following

 - Architecture : 
    + Game Engine Architecture (by Jason Gregory - http://www.gameenginebook.com/)
    + OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) (http://www.ogre3d.org/)
 - Rendering API : 
    + Introduction to 3D Game Programming with Direct3D 11.0 (http://www.d3dcoder.net/)
